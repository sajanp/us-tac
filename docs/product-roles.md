# Product Roles & Ownership

> **Purpose:** This document defines who owns what across our software products. It is the single source of truth for role accountability — when a question arises about who is responsible for a decision, outcome, or escalation, this document answers it.

## How This Works

- Each product has four functional roles. One person fills each role per product.
- A person can hold the same role across multiple products, or different roles on different products.
- **Functional roles are not titles.** Titles reflect your career and how the world sees you. Roles define who the company holds accountable for specific outcomes.
- If a role is unfilled or transitioning, it must still have a named interim owner. There is no gap in accountability.

## Role Definitions

### Product Owner (PO)

Owns the product's vision, roadmap, and priorities. The single decision-maker on what gets built, what gets cut, and what comes next. When priorities conflict or resources are limited, the Product Owner makes the call.

**Accountable for:** Product direction, feature prioritization, roadmap decisions, stakeholder alignment.

### Engineering Lead (EL)

Owns technical execution and delivery. Makes architecture decisions, ensures code quality, and is accountable for shipping on time. When the question is "how do we build this?" or "when does this ship?" — the Engineering Lead answers.

**Accountable for:** Technical architecture, code quality, delivery timelines, engineering team output.

### Client Operations Lead (CO)

Owns the client experience after the sale. Accountable for onboarding, support escalation, and ensuring clients succeed with the product. When a client has a problem or needs attention, the Client Operations Lead owns the resolution.

**Accountable for:** Client onboarding, support escalation, client satisfaction, operational processes.

### Solutions Lead (SL)

Owns the technical story before the sale. Bridges what clients need with what the product can deliver. When we need to demo the product, define technical requirements, or make the product win a deal — the Solutions Lead owns it.

**Accountable for:** Demos, technical requirements, pre-sale support, solution design.

## What This Means Day-to-Day

- **When work comes in:** Check this document. The role owner for that product either handles it or delegates it — but they are accountable for the outcome.
- **When a decision is needed:** The role owner makes the call. If it crosses roles, the relevant owners align. If they can't, it escalates.
- **When something goes wrong:** The role owner is the first person leadership looks to — not for blame, but for answers and a path forward.
- **When this document is wrong:** Update it. This is a living document. Roles may shift as the team evolves. What matters is that it always reflects reality.
